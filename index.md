## Welcome to my Gameboard

In my search to take better notes on my progress through penetration testing, I have decided to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). So this book will have a collection of commands and methodologies that I have used in the 80+ boxes I have _pwned_ over the past _x_ time. For myself, it will serve as my notebook as I complete multiple pentesting certifications i.e. [VHL](https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/), [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/), [OSWP](https://www.offensive-security.com/wifu-oswp/), etc.

### Methodology

Every pen-tester needs a checklist to run through. After running through many boxes and constantly refining my process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, I have simplified my process to the following steps:

#### Methodology Checklist

> 1. Scoping
>   - Define criteria
>   - Test initial connections
>   - Analyze given information
> 2. [Reconnaissance](recon/alpha.md)
>   - Information gathering and discovery
>   - Device and OS enumeration
>   - Port scanning
>   - Network sniffing
> 3. [Enumeration](enum/bravo.md)
>   - Advanced port scanning
>   - Common vulnerability scripts
>   - Common enumeration scripts
>   - Manual enumeration if possible
> 4. Vulnerability Assessment
>   - Vulnerability detection and analysis
>   - Vulnerability locating i.e. exploitdb, github, searchsploit
>   - Data validation
>   - Configuration management
> 5. Exploitation
>   - OS specific: [Linux](vuln/charlie.md) or [Windows](vuln/delta.md)
>   - Vulnerability testing and verification
>   - False positives and false negatives elimination
> 6. Analysis
>   - Shell or root access
>   - Access and persistence
>   - Consolidate findings
>   - [Report](writeups/echo.md) completion
